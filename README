Haven't found a feasible way to mount cloud drive on Ubuntu, so decided to write up a script to help save some pain.

This simple Greasemonkey script is designed to download all files in a Cloud Drive directory, saving myself from having to click to many checkboxes and buttons.

Initial implementation will not work recursively.
